<h3>nlmixr2 Working Group</h3>
<p>We are very excited to announce we are joining the R consortium as a
Working Group (WG). Our vision will remain the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vision of nlmixr2 is to develop a R-based open-source nonlinear mixed-effects
modeling software package that can compete with commercial pharmacometric tools and
is suitable for regulatory submissions.</p>

<h3>What is a R Consortium Working Group?</h3>
<p>A R Consortium <a href="https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/isc-working-groups.html">ISC working
group</a>
is a group of volunteers for a project that “requires the skills not
possessed by a single individual, or the amount of work required is
more than can be accomplished by a single person in a reasonable
amount of time.”</p>

<h3>What benefits does the working group provide (from the working group website):</h3>
<p>The <code>nlmixr2</code> project will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vetted by the relevant experts</p></li>
<li><p>Sanctioned by the R Consortium</p></li>
<li><p>Receive the attention of the R Foundation</p></li>
<li><p>Become visible to the greater R Community</p></li>
<li><p>Eligible for administrative support from the R Consortium</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Why did <code>nlmixr2</code> team choose to become a working group?</h3>
<div id="sustainability-and-funding" class="section level4">
<h4>Sustainability and Funding</h4>
<p>The benefits and reasons listed above are all true for the <code>nlmixr2</code>
project. However, there are additional reasons that the <code>nlmixr2</code>
team decided to become a working group.</p>
<p>One of the concerns of the <code>nlmixr2</code> team is long term sustainability
of the project, and mechanisms of funding a part of the project that
take a bit more time than can be supported by one individual.</p>
<p>Joining the R Consortium, we have a mechanism to support donations
and funding from multiple companies to work on projects the working
group thinks advances our vision. We also have the ability to
contract work that helps the <code>nlmixr2</code> team maintain or add features
to allow long-term sustainability of the <code>nlmixr2</code> project.</p>
</div>
<div id="training" class="section level4">
<h4>Training</h4>
<p>One of the other benefits not yet mentioned is training. Training has
been generously funded by Occams and Novarits for some of the past
training at PAGE and ACoP. However the administrative burden (and cost
burden) can make this occur less frequently than we would like it to
occur.</p>
<p>By joining the R Consortium can help administer training that can make
trainings more frequent and possibly occur at other international
pharmacometric conferences.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="non-competitive-space" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-competitive space</h2>
<p>Some of these are really talking about one overarching concept – a
“non-competitive space”. This means colleagues from different pharma
companies and others who use nonlinear mixed effects modeling can meet
and discuss the path forward. Their shared experience and expertise
can be used to help our R-based nonlinear mixed effects modeling tool
grow and expand.</p>
<div id="wrapping-up" class="section level3">
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>The <code>nlmixr2</code> team is excited for the synergies and possibilities that
joining the R Consortium can provide for both teams. There may be
some administrative changes in the future, but we can expect
the project to continue and have a more stable future with this
transition.</p>

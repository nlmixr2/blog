### nlmixr2 5.0

As time progresses, dependencies update, dependencies come and go, and
sometimes these dependencies change what happens to `rxode2`/`nlmixr2`
models.

One dependency change (`qs` being dropped) means that models from
before `nlmixr2`/`rxode2` 5.0 have the UI/fit models saved to disk will
may not be able to load completely in `nlmixr2` 5.0.  This is because internally
`nlmixr2`/`rxode2` encoded its models in binary `qs` format.

### Why is `qs` going away?

While the maintainer wanted to keep `qs` and its file format around, R
is changing and what is acceptable to access within C/C++ from R has
changed.  This is to try to keep people from misusing these entry
points and breaking R.

Since `qs` had specific code accessing these entry points, this change
makes it impossible to have the same file format.

Travers Ching, the maintainer of `qs` made a huge effort to create the
new `qs2` package that uses the R serialization instead of the custom
serialization.  We will be using the qs2 serialization format
internally in the C code we generate and have switched to simple lists
and environments for `rxode2`/`nlmixr2` models.

I would like to thank both the R core team and CRAN for their effort
in trying to make R more stable and secure.

I would also like to thank Travers Ching for his diligent effort in
making faster binary inputs/outputs from the R ecosystem.

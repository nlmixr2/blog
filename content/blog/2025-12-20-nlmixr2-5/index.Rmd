### nlmixr2 5.0

As time progress, dependencies update, dependencies come and go, and
sometimes these dependencies change what happens to `rxode2`/`nlmixr2`
models.

One dependency change (`qs` being dropped) means that models from
`nlmixr2` 4.0 and before models saved to a disk will may not be able to load in
`nlmixr2` 5.0.  This is because internally `nlmixr2`/`rxode2` encodes its
models in binary `qs` format and will be switching to the `qs2` format.

### Why is `qs` going away?

While the maintainer wanted to keep `qs` and its file format around, R
is changing and what is acceptable to access within C/C++ from R has
changed.  This is to try to keep people from misusing these entry
points and breaking R.

Since `qs` had specific code accessing these entry points, this change
makes it impossible to have the same file format.

Travers Chang, the maintainer of `qs` made a huge effort to create the
new `qs2` package that uses the R serialization instead of the custom
serialization, and we will be using that format going forward.  Since
it uses the R serialization format, it can always be loaded even if
`qs2` somehow has a similar issue in the future.

I would like to thank both the R core team and CRAN for their effort
in trying to make R more stable and secure.

I would also like to thank Travers Chang for his diligent effort in
making faster binary inputs/outputs from the R ecosystem.

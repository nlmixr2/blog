<h3>nlmixr2 5.0</h3>
<p>As time progress, dependencies update, dependencies come and go, and
sometimes these dependencies change what happens to <code>rxode2</code>/<code>nlmixr2</code>
models.</p>
<p>One dependency change (<code>qs</code> being dropped) means that models from
<code>nlmixr2</code> 4.0 and before models saved to a disk will may not be able to load in
<code>nlmixr2</code> 5.0. This is because internally <code>nlmixr2</code>/<code>rxode2</code> encodes its
models in binary <code>qs</code> format and will be switching to the <code>qs2</code> format.</p>

<div id="why-is-qs-going-away" class="section level3">
<h3>Why is <code>qs</code> going away?</h3>
<p>While the maintainer wanted to keep <code>qs</code> and its file format around, R
is changing and what is acceptable to access within C/C++ from R has
changed. This is to try to keep people from misusing these entry
points and breaking R.</p>
<p>Since <code>qs</code> had specific code accessing these entry points, this change
makes it impossible to have the same file format.</p>
<p>Travers Chang, the maintainer of <code>qs</code> made a huge effort to create the
new <code>qs2</code> package that uses the R serialization instead of the custom
serialization, and we will be using that format going forward. Since
it uses the R serialization format, it can always be loaded even if
<code>qs2</code> somehow has a similar issue in the future.</p>
<p>I would like to thank both the R core team and CRAN for their effort
in trying to make R more stable and secure.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Travers Chang for his diligent effort in
making faster binary inputs/outputs from the R ecosystem.</p>

<h1>babelmixr2 was released on CRAN today supporting PopED integration</h1>
<p>I am excited to announce today a new version of <code>babelmixr2</code> has been
released that streamlines creating fast, efficient <code>PopED</code> databases
for optimal design.</p>
<p>With the <code>babelmixr2</code> package you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Import your <code>NONMEM</code> model to <code>rxode2</code>/<code>nlmixr2</code> format using
<a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/">nonmem2rx</a></p></li>
<li><p>Import your <code>Monolix</code> model to <code>rxode2</code>/<code>nlmixr2</code> using
<a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/monolix2rx">monolix2rx</a></p></li>
<li><p>Use your existing <code>nlmixr2</code> model or create your own
<code>rxode2</code>/<code>nlmixr2</code> model to do optimal design.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="key-notes-in-using-poped-using-babelmixr2" class="section level2">
<h2>Key notes in using <code>PopED</code> using <code>babelmixr2</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>babelmixr2</code> requires a design dataset instead of design options,
which translates to design options like <code>xt</code>, <code>model_switch</code> etc,
(described
<a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/babelmixr2/articles/PopED.html#popedbabelmixr2-event-table-description">here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>You can get the underlying <code>PopED</code> code from the <code>nlmixr2</code> model if
you want (as <a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/babelmixr2/articles/PopED.html">described in the annotated PopED
example</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code>babelmixr2</code> loads models into memory and needs to keep track of
which model is loaded. To help this you need to use
<code>babel.poped.database</code> in place of <code>create.poped.database</code> when
modifying babelmixr2 generated <code>PopED</code> databases. If this isnâ€™t
done, there is a chance that the model loaded will not be the
expected loaded model and may either crash R or possibly give incorrect
results.</p></li>
<li><p><code>babelmixr2</code> translates all error components to variances instead of
the standard deviations in the <code>nlmixr2</code>/<code>rxode2</code> model.</p></li>
<li><p>When there are covariances in the <code>omega</code> specification, they will
be identified as <code>D[#,#]</code> in the <code>PopED</code> output. To see what these
numbers refer to it is helpful to see the name translations with
<code>$popedD</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on your options, <code>babelmixr2</code> may literally fix the model
components, which means indexes may be different than you
expect. The best way to get the correct index is use the
<code>babelmixr2</code> function <code>babelBpopIdx()</code> which is useful for using
<code>PopED</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>babelmixr2</code> uses model times in creating <code>PopED</code> databases;
therefore models with modeling times in them cannot be used in this translation</p></li>
<li><p><code>babelmixr2</code> does not yet support inter-occasion variability models.</p></li>
<li><p>At the current time, the <code>ODE</code> solution used is the <a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/babelmixr2/articles/PopED.html#comparing-method-to-the-speed-of-other-methods">fastest of the
models tested</a>, but keep in mind this is problem dependent. To me,
the most important feature is not the speed of the model, but the
ease of translating into a <code>PopED</code> database from the tools you use
(like <code>nlmixr2</code>, <code>NONMEM</code> and <code>Monolix</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the <code>PopED</code> models were restated as <code>babelmixr2</code>/<code>PopED</code>
models to show how to use the interface and are included in the
<code>babelmixr2</code> package

<p>This blog is coming right before the ACoP 2024 conference.</p>
<p>If you want stickers or to talk more about this you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stop by our poster: <a href="https://cdmcd.co/6vd4Z8">babelmixr2 and PopED: Quick Conversion of NONMEM, Monolix and nlmixr2/rxode2 Models to PopED Optimal Design Analysis</a></p></li>
<li><p>Attend our or our nlmixr2 tutorial on Thursday (<a href="https://blog.nlmixr2.org/courses/acop2024/">Using Past Models to Bridge to
Open Models and Open Science using nlmixr2</a>) if you want to talk
about this a bit more.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, see you in person soon if you are going to ACoP 2024!</p>

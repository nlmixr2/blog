<h2><code>mrgsolve</code> vs <code>rxode2</code></h2>
<p>One of the most common questions I get is, “What are the differences between
<a href="https://mrgsolve.org"><code>mrgsolve</code></a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Elmokadem2019" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>)</span> and <code>rxode2</code>?”.</p>
<p>The most common reasons for this question are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I really don’t know what tool to use, what are the advantages of each?</li>
<li>I really like one of the tools (either <code>mrgsolve</code> or <code>rxode2</code>) and I want to let my colleagues know how nice my favorite tool is.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not really the best person to answer this question since I am most
familiar with <code>rxode2</code> and can’t answer all the questions about
<code>mrgsolve</code>. My guess is that Kyle Baron is most familiar with <code>mrgsolve</code>, and that he
can’t answer all the questions about <code>rxode2</code> either.</p>
<p>To complicate matters further, both <code>rxode2</code> and <code>mrgsolve</code> are also
moving targets. What I say or others say today may change as both
systems evolve.</p>
<p>That being said I believe that <code>mrgsolve</code>, like <code>rxode2</code>, is
committed to open science and open source. And both are open tools
trying to help bring drugs to patients who need them. Both can be used
in places that don’t have access to commercial tools.</p>
<p>In short, I think you can’t go wrong with using tools like <code>mrgsolve</code>. I
believe <code>mrgsolve</code> is an excellent tool and has helped the
pharmacometric community with delivering drugs to patients.</p>

<h1>What I really like about <code>mrgsolve</code></h1>
<p>While my knowledge is limited, I would like to share the things I really
like about <code>mrgsolve</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mrgsolve</code> creates <code>C++</code> code that makes ODE solving faster than running an R function like in <code>deSolve</code></li>
<li><code>mrgsolve</code> is based on NONMEM’s data structure, while it is slightly different from <a href="https://www.iconplc.com/innovation/nonmem/">NONMEM</a>, a NONMEM dataset can often be directly ported to <code>mrgsolve</code>. For those who use NONMEM this is highly convenient.</li>
<li><code>mrgsolve</code> data structure has been expanded by allowing <code>CMT</code> values to be named and also allows a replacement event, <code>EVID=8</code>.</li>
<li><code>mrgsolve</code> has an easy way to create event tables <code>ev()</code>.</li>
<li><code>mrgsolve</code> syntax similar to NONMEM which makes it easier to translate, it even has a <code>nm-vars</code> plugin to make translation easier.</li>
<li>A feature I really like about <code>mrgsolve</code> is the plugin <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html"><code>Rcpp</code></a> that allows advanced calls into many places.</li>
<li><code>mrgsolve</code> uses a <code>C++</code> LSODA, which is a robust ODE solver.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these features make it a good candidate for translating models from NONMEM. It could also translate from some other systems (like <a href="https://lixoft.com/products/monolix/">Monolix</a>) but the analyst would need to know both languages.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-i-like-about-rxode2-and-why-i-use-it" class="section level1">
<h1>What I like about <code>rxode2</code> (and why I use it)</h1>
<p>Many of the features of <code>rxode2</code> are some of the same things I like about <code>mrgsolve</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rxode2</code> creates <code>C</code> code that makes ODE solving faster than running a R function like in <code>deSolve</code>. While <code>C++</code> compiling is slower than <code>C</code> compilation, <code>rxode2</code> has another parsing step so the compilation speed may be different.</li>
<li><code>rxode2</code> is also based on NONMEM’s data structure, while it is different slightly from NONMEM, a NONMEM dataset can often be directly ported to <code>rxode2</code>. For those who use NONMEM this is highly convenient.</li>
<li><code>rxode2</code> data structure has also been expanded by allowing <code>CMT</code> values to be named. <code>rxode2</code> also allows a replacement event, <code>EVID=5</code> (not matching <code>mrgsolve</code>). <code>rxode2</code> also supports multiplication events like <code>deSolve</code> (<code>EVID=6</code>) and a special phantom event used with transit compartments (<code>EVID=7</code>)</li>
<li><code>rxode2</code> has an easy way to create event tables <code>et()</code> which is very similar to (but not exactly the same as) <code>mrgsolve</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>rxode2</code> implementation uses a thread-safe <code>C</code> LSODA, which is a robust ODE solver. It also has the classic FORTRAN LSODA, the <code>dop853</code> solver, and an experimental inductive linearization <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Duffull2014" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Hasegawa2018" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>)</span> solver. In fact, the default method can solve ODEs parallelized at a C level. This comes at the cost of copying all the memory outside if R. This means that <code>rxode2</code> may be faster if the ODE solving is slower thanks to copying the memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>A big difference between the two packages that is also visible is model syntax. <code>rxode2</code> uses Leibniz notation and puts the ODE in a single declaration. This is similar to how <a href="https://berkeley-madonna.myshopify.com/">Berkeley Madonna</a> models are coded and are not too difficult to learn. So to me, this also hangs on knowledge that is readily available to a pharmacometrician. I personally find it more convenient than mixing R and C style code, but this is mostly a stylistic consideration.</p>
<p>I also like that <code>rxode2</code> supports <code>nlmixr2</code> style functions. You can directly simulate from this code.</p>
<p>Also like <code>nlmixr2</code>, <code>rxode2</code> can use model piping, that is modifying model features by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing single lines of your model, ie <code>inModel %&gt;% model(Cl &lt;- exp(tcl))</code> to drop a between
subject variability.</li>
<li>Adding lines to your model by <code>inModel %&gt;% model(eff &lt;- emax*cp/(ec50+cp), append=TRUE)</code>
You can also prepend the lines by <code>model(..., append=NA)</code></li>
<li>Removing lines from your model by <code>inModel %&gt;% model(-eff)</code></li>
<li>Changing initial estimates of parameters <code>inModel %&gt;% model(tcl=5)</code></li>
<li>Changing variable names by <code>rxRename()</code> or simply <code>rename()</code> if <code>dplyr</code> is
loaded.</li>
<li>Combining models with <code>model1 %&gt;% rxAppendModel(model2)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With those features and a model library many, many things are possible with little effort. (We are starting to build a model library called <code>nlmixr2lib</code> - we encourage you to contribute models you find useful).</p>
<p>I also like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The easy <code>plot()</code> method for a solved object.</li>
<li>The new package <code>babelmixr2</code> (which will be released shortly) which will convert <code>rxode2</code> model to a NONMEM or Monolix model, and autostart models based on NCA.
When it converts to either NONMEM or Monolix, the fit then runs the model against the <code>rxode2</code> model and automatically validates the resulting <code>rxode2</code> model (which can be extracted by <code>as.function(fit)</code>). To me this is the ideal way to write a model that applies to both NONMEM/Monolix and <code>rxode2</code>. There are other nice things too (but those are subjects for a future post).</li>
<li>The open source nature of the project and what it aims to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, I run <code>rxode2</code> because I am an <code>rxode2</code> developer.</p>

<p>I am really excited to announce that the <code>nlmixr2</code> team has released a
new version of <code>babelmixr2</code> and a new package <code>nonmem2rx</code> that allows
you to convert <code>NONMEM</code> to <code>rxode2</code> or even a <code>nlmixr2</code> object. To
install, simply upgrade <code>babelmixr2</code> with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(c(&quot;nonmem2rx&quot;, &quot;babelmixr2&quot;))</code></pre>
<div id="what-you-can-do-with-nonmem2rxbabelmixr2" class="section level2">
<h2>What you can do with <code>nonmem2rx</code>/<code>babelmixr2</code></h2>
<p>You can do many useful tasks directly converting between nlmixr2 and NONMEM models; you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/import-nonmem.html">Convert a NONMEM model to a rxode2 model</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/babelmixr2/articles/running-nonmem.html">Do development in nlmixr2 and then run NONMEM from a nlmixr2 model</a> for reviewers who want to know about NONMEM results.</p></li>
<li><p>In both conversions, <a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/rxode2-validate.html">automatically make sure the model is translated correctly</a> (for <a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/babelmixr2/articles/running-nonmem.html#optional-step-2-recover-a-failed-nonmem-run">babelmixr2</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then with nlmixr2 fit models coming from both conversions, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/simulate-new-dosing.html">Perform simulations of new
dosing</a> from the NONMEM model or even <a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/simulate-uncertainty.html">simulate using the uncertainty in your model to simulate new scenarios</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/simulate-extra-items.html">Modify the model to calculate derived parameters</a> (like AUC). These parameters slow down NONMEM’s optimization, but can help in your simulation scenario.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With nonmem2rx and babelmixr2, convert the imported rxode2 model to a nlmixr2 object, allowing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/create-office.html">Generation of Word and PowerPoint plots with
nlmixr2rpt</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/create-vpc.html">Easy VPC
creation</a>
(with <code>vpcPlot()</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/create-augPred.html">Easy Individual plots with extra solved
points</a>. This
will show the curvature of individual and population fits for
sparse data-sets (with <code>augPred()</code>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can even use this conversion to help debug your NONMEM model (or
even try it in nlmixr2 instead)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/read-rounding.html">Understand how to simplify the NONMEM model to avoid rounding errors</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://nlmixr2.github.io/nonmem2rx/articles/read-rounding.html#step-5-get-the-covariance-of-the-model">Run nlmixr2’s covariance step when NONMEMs covariance step has failed</a> (in the linked example, there was no covariance step because rounding errors)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I am most excited about the ability to help debug <code>NONMEM</code> models
since I spent so much time of my life trying to figure out rounding
errors and covariance steps.</p>

<div id="another-validation-metric-why" class="section level2">
<h2>Another validation metric – why?</h2>
<p>With <code>nonmem2rx</code> we introduce a new validation metric: <code>IWRES</code>.</p>
<p>Both <code>babelmixr2</code> and <code>mrgsolve</code> have used <code>IPRED</code> and <code>PRED</code> (see
<a href="https://blog.nlmixr2.org/blog/2022-11-11-babelmixr2-nonmem/">nlmixr2
blog</a> and
<a href="https://mrgsolve.org/blog/posts/2022-05-validate-translation/">mrgsolve blog
#1</a>,
<a href="https://mrgsolve.org/blog/posts/2023-update-validation.html">mrgsolve blog
#2</a>). They
validate the model for each eta and the population.</p>
<p>What the previous approaches miss is the way the unexplained
variability is coded. In general, <code>nlmixr2</code> estimates residual
standard deviation instead of variability. The <code>IWRES</code> allows the
model translations to be back-checked to make sure that the residual
variability is coded correctly.</p>
<p>It is quite handy to finish the <code>rxode2</code> conversion from <code>NONMEM</code> and
make sure it matches <code>nlmixr2</code>-type model.</p>
<p>With this extra check, you may wonder will there be any other checks
of model coding or translation? The current checks check the overall
model, the individual model, and the residual model.</p>
<p>The only other item that isn’t validated by the checks is the between
subject variability covariance matrix. Note that the structure of the
between subject variability etas is tested with the <code>IPRED</code>s. This
means as long as the covariance matrix is imported correctly, all
simulations should be reasonable.</p>
<p>There a three different things that can be used to validate the
imported covariance matrix:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Manual check of between subject variability covariance matrix</p></li>
<li><p>Indirect check of between subject variability covariance matrix
with a <code>VPC</code></p></li>
<li><p>Direct check of between subject variability covariance matrix with
conditional weighted residuals</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="manual-check-of-imported-between-subject-variability-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3>Manual check of imported between subject variability matrix</h3>
<p>The most straightforward way to validate this matrix is to do a manual
check of the covariance matrix import. With simple covariance
matrices this shouldn’t take too much time and is simply checking that
the listed covariance matches the <code>NONMEM</code> output. In all likelihood
this is going to match if you a importing the matrix with <code>nonmem2rx</code>,
so this check isn’t included at this time.</p>
</div>
<div id="indirect-check-of-imported-between-subject-variability-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3>Indirect check of imported between subject variability matrix</h3>
<p>Another way to validate a reasonable between subject variability
covariance matrix is simply to perform a <code>VPC</code>. If the <code>PRED</code>, <code>IPRED</code>
and <code>IWRES</code> all validate, a good <code>VPC</code> will also show that the
imported between subject variability matrix is correct (otherwise the
simulated values would not match).</p>
</div>
<div id="nlmixr2-cwres-vs-nonmem-cwres-validation-of-between-subject-covariance-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3>nlmixr2 <code>CWRES</code> vs NONMEM <code>CWRES</code> validation of between subject covariance matrix</h3>
<p>The last way is to directly compare <code>nlmixr2</code> and <code>NONMEM</code>’s <code>CWRES</code>
values (noting that nlmixr2 will have simulated <code>CWRES</code> values when
censored; <code>NONMEM</code> does not output values for censored values). If
they match for non-censored observations, then the between subject
variability also match.</p>
<p>This check works because <code>CWRES</code> uses the between subject variability
matrix in its calculation. Therefore if these values match, everything
will match.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="one-last-question-about-validation-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2>One last question about validation metrics</h2>
<p>So, if <code>CWRES</code> validates all components, why not use it exclusively?
Well, by using the incremental approach you can see where the model
may start to fall apart in the validation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When <code>PRED</code> validation fails tells the structural model or population
parameters are not describing the same model</p></li>
<li><p>When <code>IPRED</code> validation fails means that there are some individuals that
behave differently between <code>rxode2</code> and <code>NONMEM</code>; Perhaps <code>NONMEM</code>
or <code>rxode2</code> is using different protection algorithms for divide by
zero etc.</p></li>
<li><p>When <code>IWRES</code> validation fails, the residual specification is likely
different between the two models.</p></li>
<li><p>When <code>CWRES</code> validation fails (currently a manual step), the
imported between subject variability matrix is likely incorrect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future work for automatic validation:</strong></p>
<p>In the future, when a model is completely translated to a <code>nlmixr2</code>
fit, <code>IWRES</code> and <code>CWRES</code> validation will be performed in addition to
the <code>PRED</code>/<code>IPRED</code> validation that is currently performed.</p>

<h2>Visit our poster at PAGE</h2>
<p>We will have a poster about this at PAGE. Stop by and say hi and get
some hex stickers for these new projects. Also let us know what you
think about <code>nlmixr2</code> right now.</p>
<p>If you are astute, you may see a communication suggestion from Stacey
Tannenbaum on the poster; We are open to new ideas about how to
effectively communicate our open-source tools (if you have any ideas
also let us know).</p>
<p>As always, we are grateful for all the community support and hope this
is useful for your analysis as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>In addition to expanding our validation in <code>babelmixr2</code>, we want to
extend <code>babelmixr2</code> even more!</p>
<p>For <code>babelmixr2</code> the next steps include creating other estimation
methods (like <code>nlmer</code> from <code>lme4</code> and <code>saemix</code>) and importing models
from other tools (like Monolix).</p>
<p>I think these extra features could be useful for many people; Let us
know what you think! If there is something missing or something
doesn’t work quite right, let us know with a github issue or
discussion!</p>

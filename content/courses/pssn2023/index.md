## Workshop Learning Objectives

During the workshop, the participants will have the opportunity to
become familiar with the basic PK/PD modeling and gain hands-on
experience. Furthermore, workshop participants will learn the stepwise
framework of the Pharmacometric’s workflow; starting with a
question-based approach to graphical explorations intended to uncover
useful insights prior to complex modeling. Next, nlmxir2 is used for
building an adequate population model refined by the exploration of
the data to characterize the dose-exposure-response
relationship. Finally, the model evaluation, diagnostics, validation
and reporting will be discussed.

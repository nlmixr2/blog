## Workshop overview 

The PopSim board and DRA want to repeat the success from last year and host a workshop on `rxode2` and `nlmixr2` with a hands-on session. The workshop is intended for PKPD modellers with experience in using R and will provide illustrative examples of various modelling applications.

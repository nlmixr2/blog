## Workshop Learning Objectives

During the workshop, participants will learn how to use the `rxode2` package to simulate from ODE models and the `nlmixr2` package to estimate parameters in ODE models. The workshop will be hands-on, with participants working through examples in R. Worked examples in both PK and PKPD will be provided, and advanced capabilities of `nlmixr2` will be demonstrated. 

## Workshop overview 

We will be covering the following:

- Introduction to rxode2 simulation

- Introduction to nlmixr2 and parameter estimation

- Hands on with the warfarin PK models (part 1)

- Advanced capabilities of nlmixr2

- Hands on with the warfarin PK and PKPD models (part 2)
